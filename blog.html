            <h3>Modern Texas home is beautiful and completely kid-friendly</h3>
            <p>Making a modern home that's both kid-friendly and beautiful is no simple task.
                But for one family of six in Austin, Texas, it was crucial. So they enlisted
                designer Andrew Howard to turn the modern home into a cozy space everyone can enjoy.
                At around 10,000 square feet, the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home needed both
                cosmetic changes and structural tweaks. "We wanted to create comfy spaces where
                everyone in the family could pile up and hang out together," Howard says.
                "We also wanted to preserve the amazing views of downtown."
                Howard gave the home a subdued color palette to warm it up and incorporated sleek pieces throughout.
                “While the furniture needed to have cleaner lines based on the style of the house,
                we didn’t want anything to be off-limits to the kids,” the designer says.
                He also completely redid the kitchen, opening up the closed-off space to the
                family room so that it can easily accommodate everyone in the house.
                In the kitchen, off-white cabinetry and white marble counters are warmed up with
                light-wood flooring and ample seating from McGuire Furniture. "The challenge here
                was to open the kitchen up to make it livable and look like it had always been there,"
                Howard says. Pendants: Urban Electric. Backsplash: Neolith.
                "Just off the dining room, this is a place adults can hang out," Howard says of the sun room.
                "It has an amazing view of downtown, and we wanted to preserve that."
                Chair: Mcguire Furniture in Peter Dunham fabric. Rug: Crescent.
                Floor lamp, side table, rattan seating: Mrs. Howard. Sofa: Hickory Chair Furniture Co.
                Curtains: Rebecca Atwood. Table: custom.
